# Reentry Resources Hub

We built the [Buncombe Reentry Resources Hub](http://www.buncombereentryhub.org/) to help those returning
to the community after a period of incarceration or suffering the consequences of a criminal conviction
on their record. Now [Code we are working to scale this resource to every county in North Carolina.
We need help from developers ((Node.js, React) and writers.

For a quick overview of the architecture, check out our [documentation page][./documentation/README.md].

If you are interested in helping, check out the tasks [here](https://github.com/CodeForNC/reentry-resources-hub/projects/1).
