# Initializing the Content Directory

The ````init_content.js```` node script initializes the content directory. It will
copy the ````resources_local.json```` file to the main (statewide) directory and
create subdirectories for each of the jurisdictions listed in the jurisdictions file,
initializing them with the minimal set of content files.
