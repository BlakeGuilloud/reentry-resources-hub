# How to contribute to the NC Reentry Resources Hub

We are glad you are here. We need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:
*
*
*
*

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/CodeForNC/reentry-resources-hub/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/CodeForNC/reentry-resources-hub/issues/new). Be sure to include as much information as possible in the bug section of the issue template. Required information for reported bugs include: **Expected Behavior**, **Current Behavior**, **Possible Solution**, and **Steps to Reproduce**.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Fill out the information requested in the Pull Request Template to the best extent possible.

#### **Do you want to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest and [discuss your change in a new issue](https://github.com/CodeForNC/reentry-resources-hub/issues/new) using the the **feature discussion** section of the issue template. Gennerally, it is a good idea to discuss a path forward relating to a proposed, or existing feature change prior to submitting a pull request to avoid a rejected contribution.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about the project or contributing by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/CodeForNC/reentry-resources-hub/issues/new) and labeling it as a question.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**
