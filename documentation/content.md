# Content Architecture & Design

The content is stored in files within the ````content```` directory. The use of files
rather than a database makes it much simpler to maintain and replicate the site since
everything is checked into this repository.

The content is divided into common (national and state-level) and local (county)
directories. Each directory contains a set of standard page subdirectories corresponding
to the major topics: Home, Housing, Jobs, Public Benefits, Health Care, Education, Legal,
Support Programs, and Other Resources.
